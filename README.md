Code Challenge 2 - JavaScript Solutions
Description
This repository contains solutions to three JavaScript code challenges tackled on March 30, 2024.

Solution 1: Swap Case Function
A function that accepts a string as input and swaps the case of each character. For example, if you input 'The Quick Brown Fox', the output should be 'tHE qUICK bROWN fOX'.

Solution 2: Generate Array Between Two Numbers
A JavaScript function that accepts two numbers to generate an array between them. For example, if the two numbers are 4 and 7, the output should be [4, 5, 6, 7]. If the numbers are -4 and 7, the output should be [-4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7].

Solution 3: Prime Number Filter
A function that takes an array of numbers as input and returns a new array containing only the prime numbers from the original array. It efficiently identifies prime numbers and returns them in the same order they appear in the input array. For example, if you provide an array [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10], it should return an array [2, 3, 5, 7].
